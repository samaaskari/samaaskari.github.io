              I am an ever-evolving technical professional with credentials from CompTIA, ISC2, and Microsoft, <a href="https://www.credly.com/users/sama-askari.4324d54e" target="_blank">among others</a>. I have 8 years of experience working in small business environments across non-profit, retail, engineering, and MSP sectors in administrative, service-oriented, and technical capacities. I have a passion for personal and professional development, sharing my knowledge, and helping people. These days when I'm not working, you can typically find me with my laptop, testing scripts and code to improve my skills as an amateur developer.
